Superette
=========
	During my second year at the CNAM, I have taken a class called <a href="http://dnf3.cnam.fr/offre2013/pdf/ueNFA019.pdf" class="tocheck">Projet syst√®mes d'information : mise
en pratique avec Java (NFA019)</a> with our professor Thanh-Te HUA. This course was practical and every week we submitted a new series of code with our own explanations (see documentation).

 		The final program  called <a href="https://github.com/moranegg/Superette" target="_blank" title="on github" class="tocheck">"la superette"</a> 
 		is an information system for a store. In this system you can manage items, orders and bills. The project is programmed in an object 
 		oriented approach.
