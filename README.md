Superette
=========
During my second year at the CNAM, I have taken a class called <a href="http://dnf3.cnam.fr/offre2013/pdf/ueNFA019.pdf" class="tocheck">Projet syst√®mes d'information : mise en pratique avec Java (NFA019)</a> with our professor Thanh-Te HUA. This course was practical and every week we submitted a new series of code with our own explanations (see documentation).
		
The final program  called "la superette" is an information system for a store. In this system you can manage items, orders and bills. The project is programmed in an object oriented approach in java.
